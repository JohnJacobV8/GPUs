# Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)  

In my certification in Fundamentals of Programming and Software Engineering at Platzi, we studied one of the most fascinating advances in the history of modern computing: the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). These processors revolutionized technology by enabling advanced graphics and parallel processing, evolving from the first video games like *Pong* to today‚Äôs applications in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining.  

At the beginning, computers didn‚Äôt even have screens‚Äîtheir results were printed on paper. The first ‚Äúgraphics‚Äù came from oscilloscopes, which displayed electromagnetic waves. Engineers adapted this instrument, and from it, the first digital video game, *Pong*, was born. Over time, simple games like *Tetris* and *Prince of Persia* on platforms such as UNIX and DOS used minimal graphic capabilities. From those primitive foundations, an entire massive industry was born: the **GPU industry**.  

## What makes a GPU different from a CPU?  
The CPU is designed for complex but sequential calculations‚Äîperfect for Excel, web browsing, or office programs. The GPU, by contrast, contains thousands of smaller cores capable of executing simpler calculations simultaneously (parallel processing). This makes it ideal for rendering images made up of millions of pixels at once.  

A CPU would load an image line by line, while a GPU updates the screen almost instantly, enabling smooth gameplay and realistic animations.  

## VRAM and CUDA  
A key step forward was the creation of **VRAM (Video RAM)**, specialized memory for graphics. With VRAM, GPUs could handle textures and parallel processes in video games and simulations. This capability even enabled the rise of accessible supercomputers: for example, the PlayStation 3, combined with Linux, was used in scientific projects thanks to its powerful GPU.  

The revolution was solidified with **CUDA**, developed by NVIDIA, a language that allows GPUs to be programmed for far more than graphics: from physical simulations to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining.  

## Why are GPUs so important today?  
Parallel processing is essential in:  
- **Artificial Intelligence** ‚Üí training models that evaluate millions of possibilities in parallel.  
- **Autonomous vehicles** ‚Üí analyzing real-time visual data to make fast and safe decisions.  
- **Blockchain and cryptocurrencies** ‚Üí performing cryptographic calculations in parallel.  
- **Scientific and climate simulations** ‚Üí processing vast variables simultaneously.  

Modern technologies like **virtual and augmented reality** demand GPUs as they render separate graphics for each eye in real time. In the audiovisual industry, animation and VFX studios also depend on GPUs equipped with dedicated units for **ray tracing** (light simulation) and multimedia codecs.  

## Hardware and Cooling  
GPUs are often connected directly to the motherboard through PCI-E ports. Because of their intense parallel processing, they require advanced cooling systems: fans, liquid cooling, or even oil immersion to handle the heat.  

In mobile devices and Apple‚Äôs **System on a Chip (SoC)**, CPUs and GPUs are integrated into a single piece of silicon, improving energy efficiency and performance.  

## Conclusion  
GPUs are no longer just for gaming: they are the silent engines behind AI, blockchain, scientific simulations, and the digital entertainment we consume every day. They turned pixels into living worlds, enabled the rise of artificial intelligence, and democratized supercomputing. Every time you watch a movie, play a video game, or interact with an AI, you are experiencing the invisible power of GPUs.
